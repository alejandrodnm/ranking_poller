# RankingPoller

This project was a learning exercise for GraphQL using [Elixir][1], 
[Phoenix][2], [Absinthe][3] and [DataLoaders][4]. It retrieves the ranking of 
the top crypto coins, from the [coinmarketcap][5] api and exposes a graphql api.

I based a lot of the code on things I read on the [Craft GraphQL APIs in Elixir
with Absinthe][6] book, which is very good, also the authors are very active
in the [absinthe-graphql][7] channel of the Elixir slack.
